# Low Level Programming

This repository contains notes and answers to questions from Low Level Programming by Igor Zhirkov. It is organized by topics rather than by chapters.

However, there are other outside sources brought in to expand sections in the notes. Furthermore, some programs are written simply because they peak my curiosity and may not be anything from the book.
